# Wakura's CTF Blog

> _"Between the code and the void, I take notes."_

Welcome to my personal space for CTF writeups, hacks, tricks, and discoveries from the edge of cyberspace.  
Here I document my journey as I learn, break, and rebuild my way into cybersecurity.

## 🌐 About

I'm Wakura — 18 y/o, cybersecurity enthusiast, digital wanderer.  
This blog is my public notebook. Every CTF I solve, every rabbit hole I fall into, it ends up here.  
If it helps you learn something too, then mission complete.
